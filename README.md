# kpv-geography

Database of settlements where Komi-Zyrian is spoken. The format tries to be compatible with [lingtypology](https://github.com/ropensci/lingtypology) R package. The goal is to connect this data into language documentation and language technology work done within [IKDP-2](https://github.com/langdoc/IKDP-2) research project, and replace with this openly available dataset the currently project internal setup for storing geographical data.
